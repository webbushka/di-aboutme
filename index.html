          I spend pretty much all of my free time with my family. They are the
          coolest people around! We love doing all sorts of things together.
          From going to the beach, to watching movies, playing video and board
          games.

          I've been programming for over 12 years. I've mostly stuck with

          Since moving to Kauai my family and I spend a lot of time at the beach
          and in the ocean. We have begun surfing, boogie boarding, open water
          swimming, snorkeling, free diving, building sand castles and other
          beach friendly activities. Going to the beach has become a big part of
          our lives.
